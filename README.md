### Projects

#### GO Web Scraper

A project to learn [GO](https://go.dev). This program scrapes two popular teaching job websites, extracts information about jobs and stores them in a MySQL database on Amazon AWS.

From the database, the program builds a set of static HTML files for browsing the jobs in different ways (e.g., by subject, by location etc.)
